# /tg/station handbook

[![Publish on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Hamcha/tghandbook/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Hamcha/tghandbook/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

A fancier way to browse the /tg/ wiki. This handbook is a single page application that downloads 20+ pages from the /tg/station wiki (currently using a CORS proxy), adds some fancy filtering and Nanotrasen styling.

It adapts the pages layout to be narrow as it's meant to be used in a small window, much like a PDA or an in-game book.

The main focus is Chemistry, but the handbook is also good if you need to cross-reference multiple guides at the same time thanks to its fuzzy-search functionality.
