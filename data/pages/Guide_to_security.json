If someone is suspected of being a Traitor, get several Officers to search the person in question and possibly search their department for hidden items. Interviews with witnesses and victims can help in proving the guilt of a possible Traitor. You should generally offer the chance for a perp to surrender before engaging unless they are actively hostile. In the case of overt traitors, however, you will need to respond with a proportionate level of force.\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Improvised Weapons</b>: Order the AI to lock down the area, assess if civilians are at risk and use ranged stun weapons to subdue the perp. They are a low-risk threat to you unless they are somehow able to stun you.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Stolen Station Weapons</b>: Assume they are carrying at minimum a ranged firearm capable of stunning. Ask the AI to locate and lock down the area. Multiple Officers should attempt to simultaneously attack the perp. The use of Flashbangs will prove effective if the perp is well entrenched.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Syndicate Weapons</b>: The suspect should be presumed to be armed and dangerous, and AI should report and track the perp's location. Do not approach without backup. Consider asking the Warden/Head of Security to issue Riot Shields and Energy Guns. If the suspect is wielding Dual Energy Swords, ranged energy weapons (including disablers) will prove ineffective. Flashbangs, stun batons, shotguns or the <a href=\"/wiki/Detective\" title=\"Detective\">Detective's</a> revolver will be suitable (just be sure the detective doesn't kill the suspect).</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Spray Bottle</b>: A unique \"device\".

They can easily change their appearance at a moment's notice. If there are confirmed sightings of Changelings, be wary. Sometimes you will encounter one with bio-organic armour, a shield that stops ranged disablers in their tracks, and an incredibly deadly arm blade. Don't underestimate them under any circumstances!\nDue to their abilities, it is possible for a Changeling to kill a fellow Sec Officer and impersonate him. However, you should note that they will lack a <a href=\"/wiki/Security_items#Mindshield_Implant\" title=\"Security items\">Mindshield Implant</a> unless they had themselves implanted. Be wary of Sec Officers without Implants, as they should be arrested or kept under close watch. While you are free to terminate a confirmed Changeling, you must be 100% certain that the suspect is a Changeling before executing. If you cannot prove they are a Changeling, ask the Warden/HoS to give them a Chem/Tracking implant to watch their future activities. So if Joe Innocent walks out of the brig with a Chem Implant displaying a red or blue dot above their head on the SecHUD, and later on you see Alex Antag with the same dot, you will know that they are probably Changeling.\n</p><p>The same standard tactics in subduing a Traitor apply to subduing a Changeling, however, do be wary that some Changelings can get up instantly after being stunned and sometimes melt their handcuffs.

You must make every effort to stop them. During a nuclear threat, you are recommended to ignore most other crimes on the station. You need the crew to fight alongside you. \n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Nuke_ops\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nuke ops\">Nuke Ops</a> are equipped with a deadly array of weapons and devices that are better than yours in every regard. Guns can knock you down and kill you with a few rounds. Assault mechs and cyborgs that can tear a hole into wherever they goddamn please. Hardsuits that offer protection from the hazards of space, ballistic and energy weapons. This is a team of five-ish hardass sons of bitches who won't go down without a fight, and they'll probably explode if you manage to take 'em down. Proceed with caution.\n</p><p>Upon the confirmation of Nuclear Operatives, get the Warden/HoS to open the armoury and distribute weapons. At the same time, confirm the location of the nuke disk, which should hopefully be on the Captain, and ensure that it stays as far away from the ops as possible. From this point, you should prioritize protecting the disk at all costs. Consider asking for a bulletproof vest and helmet, since nuke ops often use bullets, and bulletproof vests block 80% of bullet damage to the chest and head, which can be very helpful. If the AI is still alive at this point, make sure it calls the shuttle.\n</p><p>When fighting nuke ops, use numbers and cover to your advantage. Avoid exposing yourself and concentrate on one Operative at a time. If you can attack an isolated operative, go for it. If you own an op, attempt to strip as much of its gear as you can before the op triggers its explosive implant. Remember that as long as the disk is with you, you only need to defend, so don't give up that advantage until you have to.  \n</p><p>If you encounter a Mech, fall back and regroup. The only way to take down a mech is with concentrated firepower or an ion weapon (like the rifle in the <a href=\"/wiki/Armory\" title=\"Armory\">armoury</a> or HoS personal laser. \n</p><p>The Syndicate Cyborg, like regular cyborgs, is immune to stun weaponry. Your best bet for countering one of these is to flash it with your flash or a flashbang and then go to town on it with your stun baton or another melee weapon. \n</p><p><b>Securing the Disk is your number one priority.</b> Keep the disk bearer alive at all costs and protect it. If you have a choice between killing an operative and saving the disk, <b>save the disk</b>! If you lose the disk, quickly secure EVA gear and scour the exterior of the station to find the Ops. If you are lucky you can catch them trying to arm the nuke.

However, even if successful, they will still be vulnerable to re-conversion. Another note: although you can no longer beat the revolutionary fervour out of someone once they have left this mortal coil, a mindshield implant <b>will</b> still work on dead revolutionaries. \n</p><p>If you mindshield implant someone and you get a message saying they \"seem to resist the implant\", <b>they are a head revolutionary!</b> You will need to exile them off the station z level or, more commonly, kill them if you want to defeat the revolution. \n</p><p>Work with your fellow security, the heads of staff, and other mindshielded crew to suppress the revolution. Oftentimes, revolutions are decided by which side can secure key departments/resources first; don't be afraid to mindshield implant crew in key departments even if you do not know they are a revolutionary, since it will prevent them from being converted later. Once you have a sufficiently large supply of mindshields, implanting random crew in the hallways is also justifiable. \n</p><p>Generally speaking, the most important departments initially are cargo and medbay. Cargo will be a vital battleground fought over, as it acts both as a critical source of mindshield implants for security and a source of weapons for the Revolutionaries. Medbay oftentimes becomes an early revolutionary hub, and a strong revolutionary medbay can make it very difficult to get security/command healed and revived. Science is the next most important department, not only for its ability to produce extremely dangerous mechs, bombs, mutations, golems and other items but also because of the possibility of an AI subversion. <b>If the revolutionaries manage to subvert the AI, counter-subverting it should be your top priority.</b> A subverted AI will shock and bolt all of the Brig doors, liberally grant all access to revolutionaries, cancel all of your mindshield orders, and generally make your life hell. \n</p><p>Engineering, while still dangerous, is less so than the other departments. Service and non-departmental crew (i.e. <a href=\"/wiki/Assistant\" title=\"Assistant\">Assistants</a>) are the lowest priority out of all.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cultists\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Cult.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Cult.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/0/0f/Cult.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Cultists</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_security&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=21\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Cultists\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_security&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Cultists\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Similar to Revolutionaries in a few respects, their goal is to sacrifice a specific crewmember and then summon Nar'Sie. \n</p><p>Fighting <a href=\"/wiki/Cult\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cult\">Cultists</a> requires all hands on deck. You must be vigilant in fighting Cultists. Anyone outside of security and the Captain can be a Cultist. Work together to lock down the station, declare martial law (red alert), perform random searches for cult items and crack down on departments. Use force as necessary if people try to swarm you or follow you around.\n</p><p>When you capture a Cultist, your options are limited. Unlike Revs, mindshield implants do not revert their Cult-status, and only force the cult to sacrifice non-cultists and turn them into constructs instead of converting them. As such, you have few options. \n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Deconversion</b>: You should be aiming to deconvert all captured cultists, however at times this may not be viable (Usually during a shortage of Holy Water). See <a href=\"/wiki/Cult#How_to_Deconvert_a_Cultist_with_Holy_Water\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cult\">How to Deconvert a Cultist with Holy Water</a>. A cultist can't be summoned by other cultists if cuffed and either grabbed or buckled.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Permabrigging</b>: Don't bother. Cultists can create a new ritual dagger from nothing, and can just teleport out. can be used as a temporary solution while preparing to deconvert them, and secure the cultist with a straightjacket.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Forced Borging</b>: Borgs can both be stunned and converted into constructs by cultists, so this isn't really worth the effort.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Execution</b>: A controversial approach both in-game and out-game. This removes the Cultist permanently and removes the threat. It is quick and easy without any unneeded effort on your part. However if the AI and borgs witness or find evidence of this, the AI can be obligated to shut you down to prevent further human harm. You are free to kill confirmed cultists, especially when pentagram halos have appeared over their heads. But deconversion is the preferred solution.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Security_Tactics\">Security Tactics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_security&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=22\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Security Tactics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Guide_to_security&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Security Tactics\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Being a Security member is all about teamwork, everything gets much easier and more effective once you work as a team.\n</p><p>There will be several tactics you can utilize as an Officer, or enforce in your department as HoS.
