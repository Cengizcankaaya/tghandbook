It's a social deduction game where players are randomly given roles in three groups: Town, Mafia, and Solo. The townies must hang all the Mafia, the Mafia must get majority vote over the town to secure the win, and Solos must complete their own objectives that muddle the game.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Phases_in_the_game\">Phases in the game</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Mafia&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=2\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Phases in the game\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Mafia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Phases in the game\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Day phase: talk about what happened last night, make calls, etc.\n</p><p>Voting phase: choose someone to put up on trial.

Assistant is the easiest claim for mafia and killing roles, so by getting lynched and publicly revealed you're giving them less power to claim easy roles. If you manage to get revealed by the psychologist, you'll be never targeted because mafia and killing roles are looking to take out detectives and doctors. USE THIS! Call out when people don't talk, call out when people are throwing blame weirdly. Call out weird votes!

That doesn't make it a good use of your power, though. A better use is if the town is caught up between two claims, and instead of lynching possibly the wrong person, then letting the other person kill one more before they're lynched, just reveal them! It really solves the whole conundrum real fast when one person's true role is revealed. Just remember, the worst whiff you can have is hitting a useful town role. Hitting assistants is fine, hitting hops doesn't let them use their power but is otherwise fine, just avoid doctors and lawyers. It's the same as a single doctor saying their role day one and getting killed the first night.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th><a href=\"/wiki/Chaplain\" title=\"Chaplain\"><img alt=\"Generic chaplain.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/6/6c/Generic_chaplain.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a><br /><a href=\"/wiki/Chaplain\" title=\"Chaplain\">Chaplain</a>\n</th>\n<th>\"You can communicate with spirits of the dead each night to discover dead crewmember roles.\"\n</th>\n<td>Probably the weakest of the investigative roles, but don't let that keep you down.

Mafia sends a random person to kill their target every night, so you have a 1/however many lings there are chance of roleblocking them, but it's always traitor killing so you're guaranteed to roleblock them. In a way, you're also a repeatable semi-psychologist because you can roleblock one of the two suspicious people at the end of the game in a disagreement and see if nobody dies.
